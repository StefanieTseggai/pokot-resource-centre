                Wanted: Communication Karma 
                <br><br>
               Got some voluntary karma to share? Pay it forward to the Pokot Resource Centre in Kenya! We’re looking for a Communications sparring partner and PR do-gooder. For only two hours a day, you’ll support the communication and fundraising needs of this vital community-based sustainable Health and Knowledge project in rural East-Kenya.
                <br><br>
                About the Pokot Research Centre<br><br>
                The Pokot Resource Centre is a new-to-build health and environment knowledge centre. It reaches out to the people of the isolated Pokot tribe with empowering awareness programs about HIV prevention, female genital mutilation, malaria and personal hygiene. The project also embeds a program on sustainable use of wind, sun and water. It is a combined effort of architecture students of TU Delft, the Kenyan East Pokot Medical Project, local constructors and the Pokot community. The Resource Centre is part of an integrated compound that consists of:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>A fully equipped medical clinic that provides advanced medical support to 9.000 people;</li>
                    <li>A fitted field ambulance unit with a radius that services up to 10.000 people;</li>
                    <li>A knowledge and awareness centre that facilitates a library, internet, research and presentation means;</li>
                    <li>Accommodation for about 150 overnight attendees;</li>
                    <li>Rain water processing facilities for drinking, irrigation and educational purposes;</li>
                    <li>Wind and solar powered energy generators;</li>
                    <li>Garbage incinerator;</li>
                    <li>Public sanitation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                
           This small-scale-big-impact project is already underway, with a successful fundraising campaign in Kenya and a pilot crowdfunder in The Netherlands. We’re half-way there. The budget for the medical clinic of € 90K is funded, now it’s time for the Resource Centre. In total, the Pokot Resource Centre needs about € 54K. Currently, we still need about € 36K to be concluded. You can help us get there!

                Your profile<br><br>
You have idea’s, want to use them for the better and have a few hours a day to do it. With your karma communication skills you’ll provide support on:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Website Content</li>
    <li>Social Media Web Care</li>
    <li>On and offline Fundraising Initiatives</li>
    <li>Press releases</li>
</ul>





<br>
Your Contribution<br><br>
The estimated workload will be around two hours a day, because we understand that you can’t feed yourself on karma alone. We expect that we’ll run the fundraiser until March. The team you’ll join consists of several dedicated young architecture students and graduates from TU Delft, dj’s, the crew in Kenya, and around 80 supporters who’ve already contributed through the crowdfunding campaign. Plan is to launch new social media initiatives, as well as benefit parties and other ways to raise the last bit of funds. We’re open to your suggestions and ideas! Help us communicate with potential donors and find a way to reach our goal. Help to provide women, children and elderlies in distant rural Kenya with the knowledge and care to tackle the issues they face:<br>

<ul>
    <li>HIV prevention</li>
    <li>Malaria treatment and vaccination</li>
    <li>Female Genital Mutilation care and prevention</li>
    <li>Personal Hygiene</li>
    <li>Environmental awareness</li>
</ul>
