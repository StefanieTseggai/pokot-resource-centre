            Niek participated in a clay plastering workshop in Delft, to learn about clay plastering and to help constructing a small restaurant. Plastering with clay is a technique that is also frequently used by the Pokot. We might use this technique in the Pokot Resource Centre. 
            <br><br>
            The workshop was organized by Vincent Scholten of Helder Architecten, who designed the restaurant of the children's farm in Delft. The workshop was led by Piotr Bronicki from Svarok, a company specialized in construction with straw and natural clay plaster.

This means the centre will not be realized in the coming years. It was a tough decision to make. We are convinced that our contribution to the project will be of a greater value after we have finished our masters. Next to our studies we will also take internships at architecture firms to increase our knowledge on architecture and construction.

Students 4 Sustainability (S4S) is a foundation run by students from Delft University of Technology and it supports projects in third world countries done by students from Delft University of Technology. S4S believes that sustainable technology can offer a solution for local social and economical problems and this is why they support these student projects, but they also try to create awareness under other students about these projects. S4S has a ANBI status which means that it is more attractive to donate, since donations are tax deductible.

            <h2>Evaluation of Preliminary Design</2>
            <h3>16.01.2012  Nakuru, Kenya
            <br><br>
            Yesterday we arrived in Nakuru after a nine day stay in Barpello, East Pokot. In Barpello we have evaluated the design with the local people, Community Health Committee and Elders. We have gained more information about local building structures and their development. We have asked several people to write a small essay about how they see the future of Barpello; what they think are the challenges of this rural area and what is necessary to develop.
            <br><br>
            Nowadays Barpello is very difficult to reach, the roads are bad, as far as there are roads. But Chief Chemoi is constructing the Tarmac (asphalt) road from Marigat to Barpello which will be finished within three years. This road will change a lot for Barpello; it will connect them with ‘the developed world’ and will provide new opportunities concerning economy and education. 
            <br><br>
            The Pokot interpret space and time very different from how people in Europe do, since they generally live outside. The main purpose of their houses is to give shelter at night and during heavy rains. All their activities take place outdoor, under a tree or somewhere in the shade. So for them, the meaning of a library, workplace or conference room differs a lot from our interpretation. We have studied, as much as possible in such short time, the way the Pokot live, move and gather and we will incorporate this knowledge in the design of the Community Centre. 
            <br><br>
            The next ten days in Nakuru will be used to finalize the design and evaluate it with the contractor. We will also estimate the time required for construction of the centre.

            Stefanie, David and Carlijn arrived safely in Pokot, but after a long period of drought, the area has been hit by heavy rainfalls and several parts the roads are flushed away. The lorry with the materials is not able to drive to Pokot. We have to wait untill the road is fixed. Meanwhile we have sent our design to architects and our professors in the Netherlands in order to get feedback.

            <h3>07.12.2011  Nakuru, Kenya
            <br><br>
            After two weeks in Barpello, we are back in Nakuru to start the design of the centre. In Barpello we displayed everything that we analysed on a big wall in our room, this is our starting point for the design.

            After completing the preliminary design, three of us will go back to Barpello and Niek will stay in Nakuru in order to arrange the preparations for construction. For example, printing the drawings so the Kenyan architect, who has done a lot of work for the diocese of Nakuru, can deliver the drawings to the local authorities for approval. Talk with the contractor about all the materials we need and about the moment we need them in the building process. Order materials in the hardware stores, gather local materials and make a cost calculation. 
            <br><br>
            The preliminary design for the resource centre consists of one big 200 square meter roof. It covers an ‘open conference room’ with a round bench and a closed volume that includes an office, library and storage. The bench is made of concrete and is connected to a stage and corridor. The walls are 350mm thick and will be made of natural river stone with mud as mortar. These stones we can collect from a nearby river.

            <br><br>
            The exact program for the centre was unknown when we were still it the Netherlands. After arriving in Kenya and meeting the Pokot and employees of EPMP we have defined a program of the resource centre, so it corresponds more to the needs of the users. 
           <br><br>
                       The program now consists of the following:<br>
            - Conference room  90sqm <br>
            - Library 	  	         40sqm<br>
            - Office 		         18sqm<br>
            - Storage 		 10sqm<br><br>
            The old nursery next to the community centre will be transformed into a computer classroom with a small storage.

            <h3>29.11.2011  Barpello, Kenya
            <br><br>
            We have been in Barpello for two weeks now. In those weeks we have talked with a lot of people and tried to gather as much information as possible. We have met the elders, the community health committee, employees of the East Pokot Medical Project and students from Barpello high school. 
            <br><br>
            Questions that we asked are: 'How does a resource centre look like?' 'What functions do you think a resource centre should have?' Many never thought of these questions, so there was a lot of discussion in Pokot. 
            Next to the interviews, we did a stakeholder analysis and analyzed local building traditions and local materials. Also we have visited several locations where the centre could be built. Different future users proposed these locations.

            Barpello, isolated and very quiet, but ... very nice! In the last days Sr. Esther showed us the town and the environment with all the problems it's facing. After these two days, we discovered the location in mind by EPMP is right on our doorstep. A beautiful site, with incredible views of the valley! It is up to us to design and build the resource centre here. Everyone is very enthusiastic and wants to help. We spoke to many people, which was not always easy because of the language barrier, but we will get there. We have started analyzing the conditions and possibilities that the location and the environment offer. Next to this we have started to define the needs of the Pokot community and the program and size of the centre. We will document all our findings in a report to be used by us and others.

            <br><br>
            Niek and Carlijn went to the village Bergen in the Netherlands to help and learn about the rammed earth blocks technique!
            <br><br>
            This project is an initiative of three architects and four artists. The architects designed a small building of rammed earth blocks, which will accommodate a temporarily exhibition of the artists. They constructed the building together.
            <br><br>
            We have learned how to make a mould, how to select adequate sand and clay and what the right proportions are. It takes 20 days for the blocks to dry and the mortal is made of the same mixture except its not dried. The pavilion is temporarily since the construction is not water resistant.
