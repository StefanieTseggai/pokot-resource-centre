<h2>DESIGN</h2>
            
    <h3>
    <br>
    The main elements of the Pokot Resource Centre are a large space for gatherings and workshops, and a library. Supporting services are a rainwater collection and distribution system, a garbage incinerator and public toilets. The new Pokot Medical Clinic is planned on the same compound.
    <br><br>
    A key aim is to design and construct a centre that is durable, sustainable and provides a healthy and comfortable environment by applying renewable energy-source and adopting local building traditions and materials. During construction the focus will be on exchange of knowledge and skills so tribe members can continue as construction workers and are able to maintain the buildings themselves.
    <br><br>
   The design is developed in close correspondence with the EPMP and the Pokot community. During our stay in 2012 we attended traditional rituals and had many talks with tribe members about local possibilities and their needs. At present, the Preliminary Design has been evaluated with the community and the EPMP. In November and December 2016 the final design will be made in consultation with an architect and contractor from Nairobi. Construction will start in March 2017.
