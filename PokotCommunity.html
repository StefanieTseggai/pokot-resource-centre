            <h2>POKOT COMMUNITY</h2>
            
            <h3>
            <br>
            Pokot are nomadic pastoralist people. Their nomadic living pattern (pursuit of pasture and water) makes it very complicated to invest in permanent houses and sanitary structures. However, more and more people are settling in one place and also modernization has reached East Pokot, such as the use of mobile phones. A traditional Pokot life is based on communal welfare. A council of elders decides on all issues concerning the community. Woman and children are not in a position to influence any choices.
            <br><br>
            Most valued by the Pokot is their cattle and being part of the community, for example by rites of passage such as circumcision. The arrival of missionaries and their schools has created conflicting values for younger Pokot. Many of the youth consider education as the ticket to development.
            <br><br>
            The local community has contributed to development of the program for the centre and will help to construct the centre. After realisation they will be involved in exploitation and maintenance of the building.
